# Project Completion Report
## Title: Interactive Dashboard Application with Next.js, React, and TypeScript

## Introduction
This document details the successful implementation of a feature-rich dashboard application, meeting all specified requirements using Next.js, React, and TypeScript. The application integrates advanced frontend technologies and multiple public APIs to deliver real-time data and an intuitive user experience.

## Development Highlights
### 1.Frameworks and Technologies: Next.JS with react and Typescript, tailwindcss.



### 2. State Management
Implemented Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, ensuring clean, predictable, and centralized state updates.
Used RTK Query for seamless data fetching, caching, and integration with Redux.
Designed separate slices for managing data domains like weather, news, and finance.

### 3. API Integrations
I successfully integrated the following APIs, delivering dynamic, real-time data:
a. Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)
Features Developed:
Displayed current weather details based on user-input or geolocation data.
Integrated GeoDB Cities API for autocomplete suggestions in the city search bar.
Designed a 5-day weather forecast using Recharts for interactive temperature trends.
Presented additional weather details like humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
b. News API (NewsAPI)
Features Developed:
Categorized news sections (Technology, Sports, Business, Health, Entertainment).
Implemented filters and pagination for seamless browsing.
Developed a detailed article modal with full content and external links.
Created responsive article cards with headlines, images, and summaries.
c. Finance API (Alpha Vantage)
Features Developed:
Displayed real-time stock data with user-friendly metrics (current price, daily high/low, etc.).
Implemented autocomplete for stock symbol search functionality.
Designed interactive stock charts using Chart.js with features like zoom and hover.
Provided historical data analysis for various timeframes (1 day to 1 year).

### 4. Additional Features
Integrated an nextauth.js authentication with google provider.

Challenges and Solutions
Challenges Encountered
Handling complex API responses:

Leveraged Redux Toolkit for efficient state updates and caching.
Customization of Tailwind CSS:
Adjusted configuration files for enhanced design flexibility without compromising consistency.
Solutions
Regular testing using mock data to ensure seamless integration.
Leveraging TypeScript to enforce type safety and catch errors during development.

Setup and Deployment
The project is fully documented, with clear instructions for API key configuration and application setup.
It has been tested in both development and production environments to ensure reliability.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
           Install dependencies:
           npm install [dependencies]
Configure environment variables in a .env.local file:

NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FINANCE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key
Run the development server:
      npm run dev
      4.  Access the application at http://localhost:3000.

### Conclusion
The project was successfully developed, incorporating all the required features and meeting the defined objectives. It stands as a robust, scalable, and user-friendly dashboard application, leveraging cutting-edge tools and technologies.
I am confident this application demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and deliver complex projects while adhering to best practices.

##Vedio Demo:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ESTACn6brgJ64uRCs-J96LvvVPW9OYn7/view?usp=sharing
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
